AAM-ify
=======

A PLT Redex-inspired language of operational semantics with an automatic "abstracting abstract machines" transformation.

Auditing the code
-----
The code is heavily commented with design decisions, descriptions of abstractions and rationale.
The following tags have significance:

**TODO[?]:**
  A point in the code where an addition is necessary/suggested (respectively) for later commits.

**FIXME[?]:**
  A piece of code that is absolutely broken or needs re-evaluation later (respectively).

**XXX:**
  Discusses caveats to a design decision, or a less sure "FIXME?"

**INVARIANT:**
  Description of a property that should hold invariably.

**ASSUMPTION:**
  Like an invariant, but based more on user interaction than program behavior.

**UNCHECKED ASSUMPTION:**
  An unproven/poorly justified proposition about user interaction.

**OPT:**
  Description of how some piece of code/data structure was optimized.

**OPT-OP:**
  An unimplemented idea for an optimization opportunity.

**NOTE:**
  A decidedly tricky piece of code follows. This note is a careful explanation.

ADDITIONAL FEATURES:
-----
* abstract counting for better equality matching [1]
* "address spaces" divvy items amongst as many stores that get automatically added.
* Addresses can be marked for pointer equality, or for equality to automatically dereference.
    * Addresses introduced by the AAM transformation are the latter kind, in the 'AAM address space.
* finite functions (dictionaries) and sets are natively supported. The burden of ensuring associativity/commutivity of meta-functions on these data is left to the user.
* pattern support for sets and maps

PLANNED WISHLIST:
-----
* build an escape hatch for smarter lattices.
* widening for control flow
* automatic garbage collection in "weak maps."
  Addresses of different spaces can occur in mapped objects.
* add a new "binding" form like When, only non-local. Failure leads to trying the next major rule.
* Synthesize a better alloc skeleton with more user guidance/annotations.
* Drop distinction between terms and expressions. Variant constructors and meta-functions inhabit same namespace.
* Add annotation for trusted termination of meta-functions so the memo table isn't necessary.
* Smarter abstraction of maps so that the CEK machine is automatically transformed into the CESK^*_t machine.

UNPLANNED WISHLIST:
------
* Arrow expanders (--> position in reduction-relation is expanded)
* Hygienic macros in expressions
* Predicative parametric polymorphism
* a compiler to output specialized Racket code implementing an input language's semantics.
  Take alloc syntax and partially evaluate?
* a higher-level language with binding specifications, synthesized substitution and
  contextual matching that compiles to a closure-based semantics and reified continuations.
